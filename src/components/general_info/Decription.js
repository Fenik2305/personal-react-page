            <p>"Readability" is a measure of how easily a reader can understand a text. In the past, optimizing content
             often involved stuffing it with keywords for direct matches. However, nowadays, such articles are rarely read,
              and search algorithms have become more sophisticated. In the competitive race for search engine rankings,
               readability is an important factor. We suggest testing tools that can quickly assess the readability of text 
               and help improve it for user comprehension.</p>
